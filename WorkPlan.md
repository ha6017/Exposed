## What is the expected Team deliverable?
Four separate analyses of user data from Google / Spotify / Facebook APIs, visualised on a web-application written in FABLE(?)

Extension: Combination of our analyses to derive even more meaningful inferences.

- [Spotify APIs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/users-profile/get-users-profile/)

## Module Structure

#### User OAuth GUI [Group Work]
This component performs the authentication for the user, in order to have his/her credentials to have read access to the various APIs used.

#### Parsing and Analysis [Individual]
Each group member is expected to write their own module, which performs individual JSON parsing of the different API endpoints, and produces analysis in a data type to be decided by each individual member.

- Darrick: 
- Ethan:
    Spotify. Custom type provider to handle spotify data and perform analysis on it.
- Yusuf:

#### Combining the Work
The outputs of each individual team member's module needs to be in a format feasible for visual representation. This is highly dependent on each of the group members' individual analysis, and might be subject to change. However, the tentative plan is to have each member produce a module with its own type provider for use in the main program.

### Which types (name and description only) are expected to be defined
Types to handle JSON data through the parsing process?

### Which top level functions (F# signature and one paragraph description) are expected to be defined?

### Which major "could be given to another team member to balance load" functions are there (F# signature and one paragraph description)

### How will code be tested (e.g. which functions will be tested inputs vs outputs, is property-based testing possible)?
